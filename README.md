# 401 Advanced Javascript

## Course Overview

This course is divided into 8 Modules, extending over 2 sections.

The first half of the course (the "Backend Section") is made up of 4 modules:

- REST APIs
- Authentication and Authorization
- Realtime (Sockets, Messages, Queuing)
- Serverless Applications

The second half of the course (the "Frontend Section") is comprised of 4 modules, focused on React

- React Basics / Component Based Design
- Hooks and Context
- Redux
- React Native and other Frameworks

  - `<Autocomplete />`
  - `<Draggable />` and `<Droppable />`
- Scalable SASS Layout and Theme Engine

## Student Operation

### Students will **fork*- the class repository

It's advisable that students first make an new organization in Github (perhaps called '401-js-their-name') that these repositories can be created in, to organize things better.

### ASSIGNMENTS

- **READING (Due before each lecture)**
  - Reading assignments should be done as articles/notes in the **wiki*- of their repo fork

- **LAB Assignments (4 per module)**
  - 10 Points (graded on the rubric)
  - ~ 3-5 Hours
  - Should be completed in a new repository for each day
  - Generally, these are smaller implementations, refactors, and practice to support the lecture concept. Not necessarily a full-scale application.
  - Code must be tested through GitHub Actions and deployed through either Heroku or AWS
  - JS Code must be documented with JSDoc
  - Students must use the README.md template (from the resources folder) to complete their assignment
  - The README requires working links to deployed code, GitHub Actions tests, functional documentation, test documentation and a UML and/or data-flow diagram.

- **DS&A IMPLEMENTATION**
  - 10 Points (complete/incomplete)
  - Installed at the root level of your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository
  - These will be used as libraries to solve code challenges

- **DS&A CODE CHALLENGE (4 per module)**
  - 5 points (3 points for whiteboard, 1 point for testing, 1 point for working code)
  - Generally requires a working implementation (above) to work
  - TimeBox execution to ~ 1 Hour

- **END OF EACH BLOCK**
  - New Data Structure (as noted above): Modules 1,2,3 & 6,7,8
  - Project Group Prep: Modules 4 and 8
  - Generally Paired
  - Takes the learnings/components/modules from the previous 4 classes and has the students assemble them into a larger/full-scale application.
